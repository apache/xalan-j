<s1 title="&xslt4j-current;">
<!--note>A later Developer release has been posted in the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir"/>. For the changes that have occurred since &xslt4j-current;, consult the xml-xalan-cvs@apache.org mailing list, or download the release and consult the release notes.</note-->
  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>&xslt4j; is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML document types. It implements the
     W3C Recommendations for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath). It can be used from the command line,
     in an applet or a servlet, or as a module in other program.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="I've heard of &xslt4j;, but what is version 2?">
    <p>&xslt4j; version 2 recasts &xslt; as an implementation of the <link idref="trax">TRaX (Transformation API for XML)</link> interfaces, part of the <resource-ref idref="jaxp11"/>. TRaX provides a
    modular framework and a standard API for performing XML transformations, and it utilizes system properties to determine which Transformer and which XML parser to use.</p>
     <p>&xslt4j; version 2 also builds on <resource-ref idref="sax2"/>, <resource-ref idref="dom2"/>, and the XML parser API in
     <resource-ref idref="jaxp"/>.</p>
     <p>For more information, see <link idref="whatsnew">What's new in &xslt4j2;</link>.</p>
     <note>&xslt4j; version 1 is no longer supported and no longer available from xml.apache.org.</note>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="How about this release?">
  <p>&xslt4j-current; 
  <!-- is a developer release that -->
  works with &xml4j; version 2.  The distribution includes xercesImpl.jar from &xml4j-used;. &xslt4j-current; is also
  compatible with &xml4j; version 1.</p>
  <p>Support for the &xslt4j; release 1 API, which predates the design of the JAXP 1.1/TrAX interfaces, has been dropped.</p>
  <p>The &xslt4j; implementation is in xalan.jar. The SAX, DOM, and JAVAX interfaces are in xml-apis.jar. These interfaces are shared by a 
  number of tools (&xslt4j;, &xml4j;, etc.), so placing them in a separate JAR simplifies coordination and reduces risk of duplication. 
  <em>Be sure to put both JAR files (and xercesImpl.jar or another JAXP 1.1-compliant XML parser) on your classpath!</em></p>
  <p>&xslt4j-current; also introduces support for <link idref="extensionslib" anchor="exslt">EXSLT extensions </link>.</p>
  </s2> 
  <s2 title="How do I get it?">
    <p>To get the binary distribution (all you need to use and develop applications with &xslt4j;), download and unzip either of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-bin-zip"/></li>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-bin-targz"/></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get the &xslt4j; sources (with which you can do your own &xslt4j; build; see <link idref="readme" anchor="build">Build notes</link>), download and unzip either of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-src-zip"/></li>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-src-targz"/></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To access previous releases, see the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir-previous"/>.</p>
  </s2>
  
  <s2 title="Where do I get Xerces?">
    <p>The &xslt4j; download includes &xml4j-jar; from &xml4j-used;. In conjunction with xml-apis.jar, this is all you need to run &xslt4j; with 
    the &xml4j; XML parser. You can, however, download the complete &xml4j; binary or source distribution from the 
    <resource-ref idref="xml4j-distdir"/>.</p>
    <note>If you plan to use a different XML parser, see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">Plugging in a Transformer
     and XML parser</link>.</note> 
  </s2>
  <s2 title="What else do I need?">
    <p>You need the Java Development Kit or Java Runtime 1.2.2, or 1.3.x, which you can obtain from <jump
    href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk">ibm.com/java/jdk/</jump> or <jump href="http://www.java.sun.com">java.sun.com</jump>.</p> 
  </s2>

    Started</link>. All of the &xslt4j; documentation on this website is included in the &xslt4j; download, as are a number of
    <link idref="samples">Samples</link> to help you start using &xslt4j2; to transform XML documents.</p>
