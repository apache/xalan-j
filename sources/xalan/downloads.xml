</ul>
<anchor name="download"/>
<s2 title="Downloading what you need">
<p>To use &xslt4j;, you need the following:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>The JDK or JRE 1.3.x, 1.4.x, or 5.x</li>
    <p>You can get the JDK or JRE from <jump href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/index.html">
       IBM developerWorks</jump> or <jump href="http://www.java.sun.com">java.sun.com</jump>.</p> 
    <li>xml-apis.jar (JAXP APIs)</li>
    <li>&xml4j-jar; (or another <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">XML Parser</link>)</li>
    <li>xalan.jar or xsltc.jar</li>
    <li>serializer.jar</li>
    <li>(Optional) Xalan Java source code</li>    
    <li>(Optional) Packages to support extension functions and elements</li>    
  </ul>    
  <p>Xalan-J has two processors, 
  an interpretive one, Xalan Interpretive, and a compiled one, Xalan Compiled (XSLTC).
  Your choice of which binary distribution to download depends on which
  of the processors you want to use.
  There are 2 binary distributions available; you only need to choose one of them.  
  Both binary distributions contain xml-apis.jar and &xml4j-jar; from <resource-ref idref="xml4j-used"/>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first binary distribution, &xslt4j-dist-bin;.zip or &xslt4j-dist-bin;.tar.gz, 
      contains the Xalan Interpretive processor, the Xalan Compiled processor (XSLTC) and the 
      runtime support packages in a single jar, called xalan.jar.
      The reason to use this distribution would be that you don't know
      which processor you are going to use, or might be using both.
    </li><br/><br/>
    <li>The second binary distribution, &xslt4j-dist-bin;-2jars.zip or &xslt4j-dist-bin;-2jars.tar.gz
      contains the Xalan Interpretive processor in xalan.jar, and the Xalan Compiled 
      processor (XSLTC) and the runtime support packages in xsltc.jar.
      The reason to using this distribution is that you want more control.
      If you are using just XSLTC you can put xsltc.jar on the classpath
      and not xalan.jar. If you are using just the interpretive processor
      you can put xalan.jar on the classpath and not xsltc.jar. Of course
      you can put both xalan.jar and xsltc.jar from this distribution
      on your classpath if you want to use both.
    </li>
  </ul>  
  <p>There is an optional source distribution available for doing your own &xslt4j; builds; see 
     <link idref="readme" anchor="build">Build notes</link>. You can download the source distribution from 
     the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir"/>.</p>     
  <p>If you plan to run <link idref="extensions">XSLT extensions</link> implemented in languages
     other than Java, then you will need an implementation of the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF).
     An open source implementation is available for download from Apache.  See the 
     <jump href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/index.html">Apache Jakarta
     BSF project</jump>. If you plan to run XSLT extensions implemented in scripting 
     languages, you will need bsf.jar and one or more additional files as indicated in 
     <link idref="extensions" anchor="supported-lang">extensions language requirements</link>.

<s2 title="Where do I download previous releases?">

<anchor name="whereis_xml4j"/>
<s2 title="Where do I get &xml4j;?">
  <p>
    The &xslt4j; download includes &xml4j-jar; from &xml4j-used;. In conjunction with xml-apis.jar, 
    this is all you need to run &xslt4j; with the &xml4j; XML parser. You can, however, download the 
    complete &xml4j; binary or source distribution from the <resource-ref idref="xml4j-distdir"/>.
    If you cannot find &xml4j-used; at that location, have a look at the 
    <jump href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-j/">Apache archive location for
    Xerces Java</jump>.

<anchor name="gump"/>
<s2 title="How do I download pre-built jars of the lastest code?">
  <p>
    If you want the latest development code but don't want to build it yourself, you can
    download xalan.jar, serializer.jar, and xsltc.jar built from the latest development code at gump
    from this link to the <jump href="http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public-jars/xml-xalan/jars/">nightly gump builds</jump>.
    You can download the lastest jars from the gump site
    to check whether the problem still exists in the latest code. 
    Note that the latest jars of interest at that site have the names with a time-stamp in the middle of their name.
    These are nightly builds, use them an your own risk!  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Gump is basically a meta-build system designed to do code extraction and Ant builds
    of multiple projects simultaneously.  Luckily, Gump is a top-level project
    that includes a complete set of
    <jump href="http://gump.apache.org/">documentation</jump>.
  </p> 
  <p>
    The Gump committers also provide a Gump service, which runs actual 
    builds nightly of nearly all Apache's Java-based projects.  The 
    <jump href="http://gump.apache.org/">results</jump> of nightly builds and
    jar files for &xslt4j; (when the build succeeds) are posted daily.
  </p>
  <p>Note: nightly builds are just that - automated builds run nightly,
     without human intervention.

<anchor  name="viewcode"/>
<s2 title="How do I view Xalan code in a browser?">
  <p>
    If you wish to view some of Xalan's files in a browser without downloading the
    whole project you can view it at
    <jump href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xalan/">http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xalan/</jump>
    or at
    <jump href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan/">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan/</jump>.  
    The link with "viewvc" in it is slightly prettier.
  </p>
  <p>
    The java/trunk and test/trunk subdirectories are the ones with the latest development code.  
  </p>
</s2>

<anchor name="buildmyself"/>
<s2 title="How do I download the latest development code to build myself?">
  <p>
    If you wish to download Xalan and build it yourself, perhaps because you want to 
    apply a patch and test it, you will need a subversion client and anonymous access
    to the repository.
    Don't worry, everyone has anonymous access.
    You can find pre-built binaries of subversion clients for different
    operating systems here:
    <jump href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html#binary-packages">
    http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html#binary-packages</jump>.
    See 
    <jump href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">
    http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html
    </jump> for more information on Apache and subversion.    
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the subverion client is installed on your local machine you
    can use the command line client program <code>svn</code>
    to get the latest Xalan-J using a command line something like this:
    <source>
    svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan/java/trunk java    
    </source>
    where the argument after <code>checkout</code> is the Subversion repository location,
    in this case the location of the latest development code, and the last argument,
    in this case <code>java</code> is the location of the local directory that the repository is
    copied to.   
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly for the test harness, you can download the latest test harness with a Subversion command
    something like this:
    <source>
    svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xalan/test/trunk test    
    </source>  
  </p>
  <p>
    Those two commands will put a copy of the latest parts in the local
    directories <code>java</code> and <code>test</code>,
    which are sibling directories.  If you
    want to test your build with
    the test harness provided with Xalan then it is easiest if you keep the
    local directory names
    as suggested. With your paths set up to compile Java code, go into the local <code>java</code>
    directory and issue these two commands:
    <source>
  build clean
  build  
  </source>
  Other useful targets may be <code>xsltc.jar</code> or <code>serializer.jar</code>.
  If you want to test the jars you just built in the directory <code>java/build</code>, change to
  directory <code>test</code> and issue this command:
  <source>
  build jar
  build smoketest
    </source>
    The first target, <code>jar</code> builds the test harness and only needs to be done
    once after the <code>test</code> repository is checked out. The second target, <code>smoketest</code>,
    runs the Xalan-J intepretive smoketest. 
    Running the <code>build smoketest</code> or other targets in the <code>test</code> directory
    automatically looks for the jars in the directory <code>../java/build</code>
    and that is why it is easiest to download the projects into suggested sibling
    directories with the given names.
  </p>
  <p>
    Towards the end of the console output you will see <em>two CONGRATULATIONS!</em> messages if all
    goes well. The end of the console output should look like this:
    <source>
    .
    .
    .
minitest-pass:
     [echo]  [minitest] CONGRATULATIONS! The Minitest passed!
     [echo]  [minitest] See details in smoketest/Minitest.xml

smoketest-notpass:

smoketest-pass:
     [echo]  [minitest] CONGRATULATIONS! The Smoketest passed!
     [echo]  [minitest] Details are in smoketest/results-conf.xml, smoketest/results-api.xml, smoketest/extensions/results-extensions.xml

smoketest:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2 minutes 4 seconds
build completed! 
    </source>
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't be fooled by the <em>BUILD SUCCESSFUL</em> messages, look for the two CONGRATULATIONS!
    messages. If you run the smoketest for XSLTC with <code>build smoketest.xsltc</code> you wil
    only get one CONGRATULATIONS! message if all goes well.
  </p>
