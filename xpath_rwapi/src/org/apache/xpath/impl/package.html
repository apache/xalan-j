<p>JavaCC-based implementation for XPath expression Abstract Syntax
Tree nodes.</p>

May be overridden by implementation-specific versions. </p>
<h2>Internal representation</h2>
An expression can be encoded through three differents internal
representations: the compact representation, the normalized
representation and the editable representation:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">compact </span>representation
minimizes the number of AST nodes for encoding expressions, even though
abbreviated expressions are fully expanded. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">editable </span>representation
encodes accurately the initial expression, without any loss of
formatting information (like the use of abbreviated expressions,
parenthesis, etc..). This representation is very useful in authoring
environment. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">normalized </span>representation
corresponds to the definition given in the <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-semantics/" target="_top">XPath
2.0/XQuery 1.0 formal semantics.</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
Note: the editing and normalized representations are unimplemented.
