<title>XPath 2.0 API Implementation</title>
<body>
<p>JJTree generated parser for parsing and creating XPath ASTs.<p>
<p>Implementation notes (Apr-03-sc): The actual grammar.xml from the XPath spec is 
transformed using a series of XSLT stylesheets into various inputs for the 
javacc/jjtree process.  JJTree then generates the parser, which gets 
checked in; this includes many of the .java files in this package - so 
don't go editing the .java files themselves without checking if 
they're generated!</p>
<p>Check carefully that you're using the correct grammar 
file, since until the XPath 2.0 specs are final, we have several 
experimental versions of the grammar checked in (Apr-03-sc).</p>
