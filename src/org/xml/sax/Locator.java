/**
 * Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 * Public Domain, and comes with <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>.</em>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
 * application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
 * passing an instance to the application using the content
 * handler's {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#setDocumentLocator
 * setDocumentLocator} method.  The application can use the
 * object to obtain the location of any other content handler event
 * in the XML source document.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
 * during the scope of each content handler method: the application
 * will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
 * locator at any other time.</p>
 *
 * <p>SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are
 * very strongly encouraged to do so.  If the parser supplies a
 * locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events.
 * If no locator has been set by the time the application receives
 * the {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#startDocument startDocument}
 * event, the application should assume that a locator is not 
 * available.</p>
 *
 * @since SAX 1.0
