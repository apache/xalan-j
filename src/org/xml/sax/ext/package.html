<h1>SAX2-ext: SAX2 Extension Handlers 1.0</h1>

<p>This package, SAX2-ext, is an extension package for SAX2.  It is
designed both to allow SAX drivers to pass certain types of none-core
information to applications and to serve as a simple model for other
SAX2 extension packages.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this package alone does add any
functionality; it simply provides optional interfaces for SAX2 drivers
to use.  You must find a SAX2 driver that supports these interfaces if
you actually want to have access to lexical and declaration
information.</p>

<p>The SAX2-ext package currently contains two extension handlers for
SAX2:</p>

<ol>

<li><a href="javadoc/org/xml/sax/ext/LexicalHandler.html"
>LexicalHandler</a>, which reports comments, the DOCTYPE declaration,
CDATA sections, and (some) entity boundaries; and</li>

<li><a href="javadoc/org/xml/sax/ext/DeclHandler.html"
>DeclHandler</a>, which reports element, attribute, and entity
declarations.</li>

</ol>

<p>This package is independent of the SAX2 core, and that independence
has several consequences:</p>

<ul>

<li>SAX2 drivers are <em>not</em> required to support these handlers,
and you cannot assume that the classes will be present in every SAX2
installation.</li>

<li>This package may be updated independently of SAX2 (i.e. new
handlers may be added without updating SAX2 itself).</li>

<li>The handlers are not supported explicitly by the SAX2
<var>XMLFilter</var> interface (i.e. events are not passed on by
default); you can subclass XMLFilter if you need such behaviour.</li>

<li>The handlers need to be registered differently than regular SAX2
handlers.</li>

</ul>

<p>To set a LexicalHandler, for example, you need to do something like 
this:</p>

<blockquote><pre xml:space="preserve">
LexicalHandler lh = new MyLexicalHandler();
try {
  xmlReader.setProperty("http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-handler",
                        lh);
} catch (SAXException e) {
  System.out.println("LexicalHandler not supported by this SAX2 driver.");
}
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>SAX2-ext Properties</h2>

<p>Here is a full definition of the two new SAX2 properties introduced
in this version of SAX2-ext:</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-handler</code></dt>
<dd><strong>data type:</strong>
<code>org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler</code></dd>
<dd><strong>description:</strong> An optional extension handler for
lexical events like comments.</dd>
<dd><strong>access:</strong> read/write</dd>

<dt><code>http://xml.org/sax/properties/declaration-handler</code></dt>
<dd><strong>data type:</strong>
<code>org.xml.sax.ext.DeclHandler</code></dd>
<dd><strong>description:</strong> An optional extension handler for
DTD-related events other than notations and unparsed entities.</dd>
<dd><strong>access:</strong> read/write</dd>
