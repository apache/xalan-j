/**
 * SAX2 extension handler for lexical events.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 * Public Domain, and comes with <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>.</em>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>This is an optional extension handler for SAX2 to provide
 * lexical information about an XML document, such as comments
 * and CDATA section boundaries; XML readers are not required to 
 * support this handler, and it is not part of the core SAX2
 * distribution.</p>
 *
 * <p>The events in the lexical handler apply to the entire document,
 * not just to the document element, and all lexical handler events
 * must appear between the content handler's startDocument and
 * endDocument events.</p>
 *
 * <p>To set the LexicalHandler for an XML reader, use the
 * {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader#setProperty setProperty} method
 * with the propertyId "http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-handler".
 * If the reader does not support lexical events, it will throw a
 * {@link org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException SAXNotRecognizedException}
 * or a
 * {@link org.xml.sax.SAXNotSupportedException SAXNotSupportedException}
 * when you attempt to register the handler.</p>

     * feature to query or control the reporting of parameter entities.</p>

     * events must be properly nested within start/end entity 
     * events.  There is no additional requirement that events from 
     * {@link org.xml.sax.ext.DeclHandler DeclHandler} or

     * <li>parameter entities within declarations</li>
