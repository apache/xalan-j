/**
 * <meta name="usage" content="advanced"/>
 * <p>The NodeSet class can act as either a NodeVector,
 * NodeList, or NodeIterator.  However, in order for it to
 * act as a NodeVector or NodeList, it's required that
 * setShouldCacheNodes(true) be called before the first
 * nextNode() is called, in order that nodes can be added
 * as they are fetched.  Derived classes that implement iterators
 * must override runTo(int index), in order that they may
 * run the iteration to the given index. </p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that we directly implement the DOM's NodeIterator
 * interface. We do not emulate all the behavior of the
 * standard NodeIterator. In particular, we do not guarantee
 * to present a "live view" of the document ... but in XSLT,
 * the source document should never be mutated, so this should
 * never be an issue.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Thought: Should NodeSet really implement NodeList and NodeIterator,
 * or should there be specific subclasses of it which do so? The
 * advantage of doing it all here is that all NodeSets will respond
 * to the same calls; the disadvantage is that some of them may return
 * less-than-enlightening results when you do so.</p>
