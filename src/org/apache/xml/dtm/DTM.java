/** <code>DTM</code> is an XML document model expressed as a table
 * rather than an object tree. It attempts to provide an interface to
 * a parse tree that has very little object creation. (DTM
 * implementations may also support incremental construction of the
 * model, but that's hidden from the DTM API.)
 * 
 * <p>Nodes in the DTM are identified by integer "handles".  A handle must 
 * be unique within a process, and carries both node identification and 
 * document identification.  It must be possible to compare two handles 
 * (and thus their nodes) for identity with "==".</p>
 * 
 * <p>Namespace URLs, local-names, and expanded-names can all be
 * represented by and tested as integer ID values.  An expanded name
 * represents (and may or may not directly contain) a combination of
 * the URL ID, and the local-name ID.  Note that the namespace URL id
 * can be 0, which should have the meaning that the namespace is null.
 * For consistancy, zero should not be used for a local-name index. </p>
 *
 * <p>Text content of a node is represented by an index and length,
 * permitting efficient storage such as a shared FastStringBuffer.</p>
 *
 * <p>The model of the tree, as well as the general navigation model,
 * is that of XPath 1.0, for the moment.  The model will eventually be
 * adapted to match the XPath 2.0 data model, XML Schema, and
 * InfoSet.</p>
 * 
 * <p>DTM does _not_ directly support the W3C's Document Object
 * Model. However, it attempts to come close enough that an
 * implementation of DTM can be created that wraps a DOM and vice
 * versa.</p>
 * 
 * <p>State: In progress!!</p> */
