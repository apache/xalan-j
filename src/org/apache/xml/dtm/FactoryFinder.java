/**
 * This class is based on the FactoryFinder classes in the JAXP subpackages

 *
 * This copy of FactoryFinder is for the DTMManager.  It caches the class
 * name after it is found the first time, if the System.property is not set.
 * If the System.property is set, then it is always used.
 * 
 * It does not use context class loaders, but we will probably need to add
 * this support in the future.  Question: If we use context class loaders, can
 * we still cache the class (do we need to also cache the class loader for
 * comparison purposes)?
