# Xalan-specific output properties.  These can be overridden in the stylesheet 
# assigning a xalan namespace.  For example:
# <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
#          xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
#          xmlns:xalan="http://xml.apache.org/xalan">
#  <xsl:output method="html" encoding="UTF-8"
#              xalan:content-handler="MyContentHandler"/>
#  ...
# Note that the colon after the protocol needs to be escaped.
