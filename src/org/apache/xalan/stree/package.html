  <body>
    <p>Implementation of the Xalan Source Tree, which is a DOM implementation that 
    is optimized for XSLT processing and the needs of Xalan -- derived nodes can index 
    the children, and, combined with specialized node iterators (and tree walkers) can
    provide optimal child retrieval.<p>
