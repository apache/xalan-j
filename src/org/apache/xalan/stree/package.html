  <title>Xalan Source Tree Package.</title>
  <body>
    <p>Implementation of the Xalan Source Tree, which is a DOM implementation that 
    is optimized for XSLT processing and the needs of Xalan.  The primary feature 
    of the Stree is that nodes can be parsed on one thread, while they are being 
    read on another thread.  If a requested child node has not yet arrived, the 
    reading thread will wait until the parse thread has produced the node, thrown 
    an exception, or marked the parent as complete.  Stree nodes also contain a 
    document order index, which is used in conjunction with the XPath module to 
    optimize certain operations. Stree text nodes also do not build String objects 
    until requested, and are capable of directly dispatching text events to a 
    ContentHandler.<p>
