  <title>Xalan Templates Package.</title>
  <body>
    <p>Contains XSLT "beans", that act as a data source for the transformation.
       The StylesheetRoot class implements the TRaX Templates interface -- the 
       ElemTemplateElement is the superclass of all XSLT instructions, including 
       Stylesheet, StylesheetComposed is used for stylesheets that are composed of 
       multiple included stylesheets, and many properties have pure data accessors as 
       well as "composed" accessors -- ElemTemplateElements are executed via an 
       "execute" method, which puts a bit of a fuzzy line between the "transformer"
       package and the "templates" package -- this as opposed to a visitor pattern 
       in the transformer package.<p>
