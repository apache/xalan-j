    <p>In charge of run-time transformations and the production of result trees.</p>
    
    <p>TransformerImpl implements the TRaX Transformer interface, and extends the SAX XMLFilterImpl. It uses a SAX XMLParser to
    parse the XML input and sends parse events to an input SAX ContentHandler, org.apache.xalan.stree.SourceTreeHandler, which in
    turn uses org.apache.xalan.utils.DOMBuilder to assemble the input into a DOM tree (this step is unnecessary if the XML input
    is submitted as a DOM).</p>
    <p>For each node in the XML source, TransformerImpl uses the StylesheetRoot and underlying XSLT schema to determine which
    template to apply: one of the templates in the StylesheetRoot, a default template rule as specified in the XSLT spec, or
    none.</p>
    <p>The Transformer works with org.apache.xalan.transformer.ResultTreeHandler to forward the SAX events produced by this
    process to the appropriate output ContentHandler, a serializer if the Result object has been set up to write to a stream or
    file, a DOMBuilder utility if the output is to be a DOM tree.</p>
    <p>To the degree possible, the parsing of the XML source and application of the Templates object to that source are performed
    concurrently in separate threads. When necessary, the Transformer waits for the parse events that must be in place before a
    given template may be applied.</p>
