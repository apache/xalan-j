  <body>
    <p>Defines an interface for processing transformation instructions, 
       performing tree transformations via a transformer, and sending the 
       result to SAX handlers, and interfacing to a {@link org.xml.serialize.Serializer} if needed.<p>

    <h3>The TRaX Interfaces</h3>
    
    <p>A TRaX {@link org.xml.trax.Processor} is an object that processes transformation 
       instructions, or {@link org.xml.trax.Templates}.  The {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} provide 
       {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer}s, which transforms a source tree into a result tree.</p>
    <p>To use the TRaX interface, you create an {@link org.xml.trax.Processor}, which can 
       provide {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} 
       from a variety of sources. The {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} object 
       provides a {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer}.  The {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} processes the 
       {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource} according to the 
       {@link org.xml.trax.Templates}, parameters, and 
       {@link org.xml.serialize.OutputFormat} properties.</p>
       
    <p>To create a {@link org.xml.trax.Processor}, you call the factory interface on 
       the {@link org.xml.trax.Processor} class.  The {@link org.xml.trax.Processor} is 
       "plugged" into the platform in one of two 
       ways: 1) as a platform default, and 2) through external specification by a 
       system property named "org.xml.trax.Processor.[type]" 
       obtained using java.lang.System.getProperty().  The [type] part of the property specifies 
       the language to be used, for instance, "org.xml.trax.Processor.xslt" would 
       specify an XSLT processor.</p>
       
    <p>Both the {@link org.xml.trax.Processor} and the {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} 
       objects let you ask about particular features 
       that the processor supports.  You can do this using SAX style getFeature/setFeature 
       methods.  For instance, some processors may not support DOM trees as a method of 
       input.  In this case, it is wise to first ask the {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} 
       if it supports the "http://xml.org/trax/features/dom/input" feature.  
       Those methods that may be optional are clearly documented in the method headers.</p>
       
    <p>The {@link org.xml.trax.Processor}'s primary purpose is to process transformation 
       instructions, such as 
       an XSLT stylesheet, into a threadsafe {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} object.  
       The {@link org.xml.trax.Processor} can get these 
       instructions from either a SAX {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource}, or from a DOM tree.  
       The {@link org.xml.trax.Processor} 
       can also return a list of {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource}s from a XML document 
       that are specified via 
       the xml-stylesheet instruction.  These {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource}s can 
       then be handed in to a 
       process instruction to create a {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} object.</p>
       
    <p>The {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} object is a bag of instructions 
       that tells the {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} how to 
       transform a source tree.  It is meant to be thread safe for use in multiple threads 
       at the same time.  At this time there are only two methods on the {@link org.xml.trax.Templates}
       object.  newTransformer() creates a {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} object that is 
       associated with the {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} object.  getOutputFormat() allows 
       you to get a {@link org.xml.serialize.OutputFormat} object which you may then modify 
       and hand in to the {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} object.</p>
       
    <p>The {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} object represents a single transform.  You can only 
       use the Transformer object in a single thread at a time.  You can pass parameters to the 
       {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} object, which will then be used from within the 
       transform.  You can also set the OutputFormat, which will override the properties 
       obtained from the owning {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} object.  The primary method on 
       the {@link org.xml.trax.Templates} object is transform(...), which takes as input a 
       SAX {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource}.  But there are a couple of other ways to cause a 
       transformation to occur.  You can use the transformNode(...) method to transform a DOM 
       node.  You can also obtain SAX parse event handler interfaces, such as {@link org.xml.sax.DocumentHandler},
       which can then be used as SAX event catchers.  A {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} is 
       also a SAX {@link org.xml.sax.XMLFilter}.  An XML filter is like an XML reader/parser, 
       except that it obtains its events from another XML reader rather than a primary source like
       an XML document or database.  Useing the {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer} as a 
       {@link org.xml.sax.XMLFilter} is one method to use to chain or pipe transformations.
       It also allows you to use a {@link org.xml.sax.XMLFilter} polymorphicaly as a 
       {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}.</p>
       
     <p>The output of a transformation is specified via a {@link org.xml.trax.Result} object. 
        This is very much like a {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource}, except that it allows you 
        to specify OutputStreams, Writers, or DOM Nodes.  To specify SAX output, simply use 
        the {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader} methods (since the {@link org.xml.trax.Transformer}
        is also a {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}), and call the transform() method that takes 
        only an input source. </p>
