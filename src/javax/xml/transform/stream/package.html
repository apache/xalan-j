<p>This package implements stream and URL specific transformation APIs.
		</p>
<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource} class
		provides methods for specifying {@link java.io.InputStream} input,
		{@link java.io.Reader} input, and URL input in the form of strings. Even
		if an input stream or reader is specified as the source,
		{@link javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource#setSystemId} should still
		be called, so that the transformer can know from where it should resolve
		relative URIs. The public identifier is always optional: if the application
		writer includes one, it will be provided as part of the
		{@link javax.xml.transform.SourceLocator} information.</p>
<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult} class
		provides methods for specifying {@link java.io.OutputStream},
		{@link java.io.Writer}, or an output system ID, as the output of the
		transformation result.</p>
<p>In both the stream and result, normally streams should be used rather
		than readers or writers, since readers and writers already have the encoding
		establish to and from the internal Unicode format. However, there are times
		when it is useful to write to a character stream, such as when using a
		StringWriter in order to write to a String, or in the case of reading source
		XML from a StringReader.</p>
<p>The following code fragment illustrates the use of the stream source
		and result objects.</p>
<code>
<pre>    // Create a transform factory instance.
    TransformerFactory tfactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();

    InputStream xslIS = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(xslID));
    StreamSource xslSource = new StreamSource(xslIS);
    // Note that if we don't do this, relative URLs can not be resolved correctly!
    xslSource.setSystemId(xslID);

    // Create a transformer for the stylesheet.
    Transformer transformer = tfactory.newTransformer(xslSource);
    
    InputStream xmlIS = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(sourceID));
    StreamSource xmlSource = new StreamSource(xmlIS);
    // Note that if we don't do this, relative URLs can not be resolved correctly!
    xmlSource.setSystemId(sourceID);
    
    // Transform the source XML to System.out.
    transformer.transform( xmlSource, new StreamResult(System.out));
</pre>
