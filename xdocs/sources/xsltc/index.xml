    <!--========================= OVERALL DESIGN ==========================-->
    <anchor name="overall"/>
    <s3 title="XSLTC overall design">

    <p>The figure below describes the overall design of XSLTC's compiler:</p>
    <p><img src="overall_design.gif" alt="overall_design.gif"/></p>
    <p><ref>Figure 1: Architectural overview of XSLTC</ref></p>

    <p>A client application can use XSLTC either through its
    <link idref="xsltc_native_api">native API</link> or through or
    implementation of the <link idref="xsltc_trax_api">TrAX API</link>. The
    <link anchor="compiler">compiler</link> generates one or more Java classes
    (we have chosen to call them 'translets').
    The <link anchor="runtime">runtime library</link> contains classes that
    can load these translets and use them to transform XML documents to some
    markup language or plain text. There is also a detailed document describing
    <link idref="xsltc_namespace">namespace handling</link> in all parts of
    XSLTC (compiler, internal DOM, and output handler).</p>

    </s3>

    <!--========================= COMPILER DESIGN =========================-->
    <anchor name="compiler"/>
    <s3 title="XSLTC compiler design">

    <p>The figure below describes the overall design of XSLTC's compiler:</p>
    <p><img src="compiler_design.gif" alt="compiler_design.gif"/></p>
    <p><ref>Figure 2: Compiler architecture overview</ref></p>

    <p>There is also a <link idref="xsltc_compiler">high-level design</link>
    document for XSLTC's compiler. Apart from that you can also find separate
    design documents for some XSL elements and XPath expressions, patterns
    and functions:</p>

    </s4>
    </s3>

    <!--========================= RUNTIME DESIGN ==========================-->
    <anchor name="runtime"/>
    <s3 title="XSLTC runtime library design">

    <p>The runtime portion of XSLTC has four main components; the internal DOM
    implementation (not W3C), the translet class(es), the runtime
    library and the output processor:</p>

    <p><img src="runtime_design.gif" alt="runtime_design.gif"/></p>
    <p><ref>Figure 3: Runtime library architecture overview</ref></p>

    <p>The <link idref="xsltc_runtime">runtime library design</link> document
    describes the structure of the compiled translet as well as the translet
    runtime library.</p>

    <p>The <link idref="xsltc_dom">Internal DOM design</link> document
    describes the components and structure of the internal DOM, support for
    DOM2 navigation, the DOM adapter, DOM multiplexer, and DOM builder.</p>

    <p>The <link idref="xsltc_iterators">iterator design</link> document
    describes the general design of the internal DOM iterators and describes
    some of the more complicated iterators in detail.</p>

    </s3>

    <!--========================== TRAX DESIGN ===========================-->
    <anchor name="trax"/>
    <s3 title="XSLTC TrAX Implementation">

    <p>An implementation of the JAXP/ TrAX interface was added on to XSLTC
    at a late stage. Special care was taken to preserve the small footprint
    and high performance of XSLTC. The following design was used to wrap
    XSLTC behind a lightweight (but complete) TrAX implementation:</p>

    <p><img src="trax_translet_wrapping.gif" alt="trax_translet_wrapping.gif"/></p>
    <p><ref>Figure 4: XSLTC TrAX interface implementation</ref></p>

    <p>The <link idref="xsltc_trax">TrAX design</link> document contains
    details of XSLTC's TrAX implementation.</p>

    <p>XSLTC also has a 'smart' TrAX <code>TransformerFactory</code> class
    that will alternate between using XSLTC and Xalan for transformations.
    This factory class will make its choices based on usage patterns. This will
    be described in a separate design document.</p>
