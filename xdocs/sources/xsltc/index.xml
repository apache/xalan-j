    <p>Each XSL element/function and XPath expression/pattern is represented by
  its own class in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Some of these classes have
  their own design documents (I am working on the rest of them):</p>
    <s3 title="XSL elements">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <link idref="xsl_whitespace_design">&lt;xsl:preserve-space&gt;/&lt;xsl:strip-space&gt;</link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <link idref="xsl_sort_design">&lt;xsl:sort&gt;</link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <link idref="xsl_key_design">&lt;xsl:key&gt;</link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <link idref="xsl_comment_design">&lt;xsl:comment&gt;/&lt;xsl:message&gt;</link>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </s3>
        <s3 title="XSL functions">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <link idref="xsl_key_design">key()</link>

  <s2 title="Runtime library/DOM design">
  <p><link idref="xsltc_runtime"><img src="runtime_architecture.gif" alt="runtime_architecture.gif"/></link></p>
  <p><ref>Figure 2: Runtime library architecture overview</ref></p>
  <p>Click on the picture to jump to the overall design document for the XSLTC
  runtime library. This document describes the structure of the compiled
  translet as well as the translet runtime library.</p> 
  <p>The <link idref="xsltc_dom">Internal DOM</link> describes the components and structure of the internal DOM,
   support for DOM2 navigation, the DOM adapter, DOM multiplexer, and DOM builder.</p>
    <p><link idref="xsltc_namespace">Namespaces</link> explains how XSLTC (including the compiler) handles
     namespaces.</p>
