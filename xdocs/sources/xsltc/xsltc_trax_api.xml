<s1 title="XSLTC TrAX API">

  <s2 title="The JAXP/TrAX API">

  <p>XSLTC is 100% compliant with the TrAX poriton of the
  <jump href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/index.html">JAXP API</jump>. This
  API is a standard extension to Java and there is not much point in describing
  it in detail in this document.</p>

  </s2>

  <s2 title="XSLTC's extensions to JAXP/TrAX">

  <p>The <code>Source</code> and <code>Result</code> classes within TrAX are
  used to handle input and output documents. These classes can be extended to
  encapsulate additional input types. XSLTC's TrAX implementation contains an
  extension to the <code>Source</code> class:</p><source>
    org.apache.xalan.xsltc.trax.XSLTCSource</source>

  <p>This extension class can be used to build and encapsulate XSLTC's internal
  DOM and DTD handler:</p><source>
    public void run(String xmlfile, String xslfile) {

        // Set up your factory classes
        SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
        TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();

        try {
            // Create a namespace-aware parser
            try {
                factory.setFeature(Constants.NAMESPACE_FEATURE,true);
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                factory.setNamespaceAware(true);
            }
            final SAXParser parser = factory.newSAXParser();
            final XMLReader reader = parser.getXMLReader();

            // Build an XSLTCSource for the input XML document
            XSLTCSource source = new XSLTCSource();
            source.build(reader, xmlfile);

            // Build a StreamSource for the stylesheet
            StreamSource stylesheet = new StreamSource(xslfile);

            // Create a Transformer instance and process the input
            Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer(stylesheet);
            transformer.transform(source, new StreamResult(System.out));
        }
	:
	:
    }</source>

  <p>If you do chose to implement a DOM cache, you should have your cache
  implement the <code>javax.xml.transform.URIResolver</code> interface so
  that documents loaded by the <code>document()</code> function are also read
  from your cache.</p>
