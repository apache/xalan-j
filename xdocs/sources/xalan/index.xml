<s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>&xslt4j; is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into 
       HTML, text, or other XML document types. It implements <resource-ref idref="xslt"/> and 
       <resource-ref idref="xpath"/>.  It can be used from the command line, in an applet or a 
       servlet, or as a module in other program.</p>
    <p>&xslt4j; recasts &xslt; as an implementation of the <link idref="trax">
       Transformation API for XML (TrAX)</link> interfaces, part of the <resource-ref idref="jaxp12"/>. 
       TrAX provides a  modular framework and a standard API for performing XML transformations, and
       it utilizes system properties to determine which Transformer and which XML parser to use.</p>
    <p>&xslt4j; also builds on <resource-ref idref="sax2"/> and <resource-ref idref="dom2"/>.</p>
  
    <p>For more information, see <link idref="whatsnew">What's new in &xslt4j2;</link>.</p>
    <note>&xslt4j; version 1 is no longer supported and no longer available from xml.apache.org.</note>
</s2>

<anchor name="current"/>
<s2 title="How about this release?">
  <p>&xslt4j-current; works with &xml4j;, and the distribution includes xercesImpl.jar from &xml4j-used;.</p>
  <p>Support for the &xslt4j; release 1 API, which predates the design of the JAXP 1.2/TrAX interfaces, 
     has been dropped.</p>
  <p>The &xslt4j; implementation is in xalan.jar. The SAX, DOM, and JAVAX interfaces are in xml-apis.jar. 
     These interfaces are shared by a number of tools (&xslt4j;, &xml4j;, etc.), so placing them in a 
     separate JAR simplifies coordination and reduces risk of duplication. 
  <em>Be sure to put both JAR files (and xercesImpl.jar or another JAXP 1.2-compliant XML parser) on your classpath!</em></p>

   All of the &xslt4j; documentation on this website is included in the &xslt4j; download, as are a number of
