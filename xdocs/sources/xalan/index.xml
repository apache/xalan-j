<s1 title="&xslt4j-current;">
<!--note>A later Developer release has been posted in the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir"/>. For the changes that have occurred since &xslt4j-current;, consult the xml-xalan-cvs@apache.org mailing list, or download the release and consult the release notes.</note-->
  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML document types. It implements the
     W3C Recommendations for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath). It can be used from the command line,
     in an applet or a servlet, or as a module in other program.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="I've heard of &xslt4j;, but what is version 2?">
    <p>&xslt4j; version 2 recasts Xalan as an implementation of the <link idref="trax">TRaX (Transformation API for XML)</link> interfaces, part of the <resource-ref idref="jaxp11"/>. TRaX provides a
    modular framework and a standard API for performing XML transformations, and it utilizes system properties to determine which Transformer and which XML parser to use.</p>
     <p>&xslt4j; version 2 also builds on <resource-ref idref="sax2"/>, <resource-ref idref="dom2"/>, and the XML parser API in
     <resource-ref idref="jaxp"/>.</p>
     <p>For more information, see <link idref="whatsnew">What's new in &xslt4j2;</link>.</p>
     <note>&xslt4j; version 1 is no longer supported and no longer available from xml.apache.org.</note>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="How about this release?">
  <p>Following a series of Developer releases, &xslt4j-current; represents a stable, production-quality release with 
  the <link idref="dtm">DTM (Document Table Model)</link>. &xslt4j; uses the DTM to represent the XML source document 
  to be transformed.</p>
  <p>Starting with 2.2.D12, we have reduced xalan.jar to just include the &xslt4j; implementation, placing the SAX, DOM, 
  and JAVAX interfaces in xml-apis.jar. These interfaces are shared by a number of tools (&xslt4j;, &xml4j;, etc.), so placing them in a 
  separate JAR simplifies coordination and reduces risk of duplication. <em>Be sure to put both JAR files on your classpath!</em></p>
  </s2> 
  <s2 title="How do I get it?">
    <p>To get the binary distribution (all you need to use and develop applications with &xslt4j;), download and unzip either of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-bin-zip"/></li>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-bin-targz"/></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get the &xslt4j; sources (with which you can do your own &xslt4j; build; see <link idref="readme" anchor="build">Build notes</link>), download and unzip either of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-src-zip"/></li>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-src-targz"/></li>
    </ul>
  </s2>
  
  <s2 title="Where do I get Xerces?">
    <p>The Xalan download includes xerces.jar from &xml4j-used;. This is all you need to run Xalan with the Xerces XML parser. 
    You can, however, download the complete Xerces distribution from the <resource-ref idref="xml4j-distdir"/>. If you are interested in testing
    or prototyping &xml4j2;, you can run &xslt4j-current; with &xml4j; 2.0.0.beta3; be sure the use the JAVAX interfaces, not the &xml4j; 1
    compatibility layer, which does not work with &xml4j; 2.0.0.beta3.</p>
    <note>If you plan to use a different XML parser, see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">Plugging in a Transformer
     and XML parser</link>.</note> 
  </s2>
  <s2 title="What else do I need?">
    <p>You need the Java Development Kit or Java Runtime 1.1.8, 1.2.2, or 1.3, which you can obtain from <jump
    href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk">ibm.com/java/jdk/</jump> or <jump href="http://www.java.sun.com">java.sun.com</jump>.</p> 
  </s2>  
    <s2 title="For more information...">
    <p>For more information, go to <link idref="overview">Xalan Overview</link> and <link idref="getstarted">Getting
    Started</link>. All of the Xalan documentation on this website is included in the Xalan download, as are a number of
    <link idref="samples">Samples</link> to help you start using &xslt4j2; to transform XML documents.</p>
