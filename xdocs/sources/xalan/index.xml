  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML document types. It implements the
     W3C Recommendations for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath). It can be used from the command line,
     in an applet or a servlet, or as a module in other program.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="I've heard of &xslt4j;, but what is version 2?">
    <p>&xslt4j; version 2 recasts Xalan as an implementation of the <resource-ref idref="trax"/> interfaces, part of the <resource-ref idref="jaxp11"/>. TRaX provides a
    modular framework and a standard API for performing XML transformations, and it utilizies system properties to determine which Transformer and which XML parser to use.</p>
     <p>&xslt4j; version 2 also builds on <resource-ref idref="sax2"/>, <resource-ref idref="dom2"/>, and the XML parser API in
     <resource-ref idref="jaxp"/>.</p>
     <p>For more information, see <link idref="whatsnew">What's new in &xslt4j2;</link>.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="How about this release?">
    <p>&xslt4j-current; is a beta Developer's release of &xslt4j2;. Since &xslt4j; 2.0.D01, TrAX has been revised and integrated with the XMP Parser API in the Java API for XML Processing, so &xslt4j; has been revised accordingly. For the details, and for information about the known limitations with this beta release, see the <link idref="readme">Release notes</link>. Please send your comments, bug reports, and feedback to the <human-resource-ref idref="xalandev"/></p>
  </s2> 
  <s2 title="How do I get it?">
    <p>Download and unzip either of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-zip"/></li>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-targz"/></li>
    </ul>     
  </s2>
  
  <s2 title="Where do I get Xerces?">
    <p>The Xalan download includes xerces.jar from &xml4j-used;. This is all you need to run Xalan with the Xerces XML parser. 
    You can, however, download the complete Xerces distribution from the <resource-ref idref="xml4j-distdir"/>.</p>
    <note>If you plan to use a different XML parser, see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">Plugging in a Transformer
     and XML parser</link>.</note> 
  </s2>
  <s2 title="What else do I need?">
    <p>You need the Java Development Kit or Java Runtime 1.1.8, 1.2.2, or 1.3, which you can obtain from <jump
    href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk">ibm.com/java/jdk/</jump> or <jump href="http://www.java.sun.com">java.sun.com</jump>.</p> 
  </s2>  
    <s2 title="For more information...">
    <p>For more information, go to <link idref="overview">Xalan Overview</link> and <link idref="getstarted">Getting
    Started</link>. All of the Xalan documentation on this website is included in the Xalan download, as are a number of
    <link idref="samples">Samples</link> to help you start using &xslt4j2; to transform XML documents.</p>
