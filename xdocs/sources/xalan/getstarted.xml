<anchor name="download"/>
<s2 title="Downloading what you need">
<p>To use &xslt4j;, you need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The JDK or JRE 1.2.2, or 1.3.x</li>
<li>xalan.jar</li>
<li>xml-apis.jar</li>
<li>&xml4j-jar;, or another <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">XML Parser</link></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the JDK or JRE from <jump href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk">ibm.com/java/jdk/</jump> or <jump href="http://www.java.sun.com">java.sun.com</jump>.</p> 
<p>For the binary distribution, which includes everything required to use and build applications with &xslt4j;, download <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-bin-zip"/> or <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-bin-targz"/>. Both of these files contain &xslt4j-current; (with xalan.jar and xml-apis.jar) and &xml4j-jar; from <resource-ref idref="xml4j-used"/>. You can use a zip or tar utility to expand these files into a full build.</p>
<p>If you want the &xslt4j; source files, download <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-src-zip"/> or <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-src-targz"/>. After you expand these files into the complete source tree, you can use <resource-ref idref="ant"/> to do your own builds. For more information, see <link idref="readme" anchor="build">Build notes</link>.</p>

<p>If you plan to run <link idref="extensions">XSLT extensions</link>, you need bsf.jar, which is included in the &xslt4j; distribution. If you plan to run XSLT extensions implemented in Javascript or another scripting language, you will need one or more additional files as indicated in <link idref="extensions" anchor="supported-lang">extensions language requirements</link>.</p>
</s2><anchor name="classpath"/>
<s2 title="Setting up the system classpath">
<p>At the very minimum, you must include xalan.jar, xml-apis.jar, and &xml4j-jar; -- or another conformant XML parser -- see 
<link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">Plugging in a Transformer and XML parser</link>) on the system classpath. To run the sample applications,
include xalansamples.jar (all samples other than the servlet) and xalanservlet.jar. To run extensions, include bsf.jar. All these JAR files 
are distributed with &xslt4j;. For extensions implemented in JavaScript or another scripting language, see <link idref="extensions" anchor="supported-lang">extensions language 
requirements</link> to identify any additional JAR files you must place on the classpath and where you can get them.</p>
&xsltcclasspath;
<p>If you are using JDK or JRE 1.2.2, include tools.jar on the classpath.</p>
</s2><anchor name="samples"/>
<s2 title="Trying out the samples">
<p>The &xslt4j; distribution includes a number of basic sample applications. These samples are easy to run, and you can review the source files -- all of which are brief -- to see just how they work.</p>
<p>To run the samples, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up your classpath (see above), including xalansamples.jar and (for the servlet) xalanservlet.jar.</li>
<li>Be sure the java executable is on your path.</li>
<li>Go to the samples subdirectory containing the sample (use the DOS shell if you are running Windows).</li>
<li>Use the java executable to run the sample from the command line.</li>
<li>Examine the application source and result files.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, go to the SimpleTransform subdirectory and issue the following command:</p>
<p><code>java SimpleTransform</code></p>
<p>The sample writes the transformation result  to a file (birds.out). To see how the example works, examine the source files: birds.xml, birds.xsl, and SimpleTransform.java.</p>
<p>The extensions examples require additional JAR files on the classpath, and the procedure for running the sample applet and sample servlet is different. For more information about all the samples, see <link idref="samples">&xslt4j; Samples</link>.</p>
</s2><anchor name="commandline"/>
<s2 title="Performing your own transformations from the command line">
<p>java.org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process provides a basic utility for performing transformations from the command line. You use this utility, for example, to run several of the extensions samples. The command line for most standard transformations is as follows:</p>
<p><code>java org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process -in <ref>xmlSource</ref></code><br/>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-xsl <ref>stylesheet</ref> -out <ref>outputfile</ref></code></p>
<p>where <ref>xmlSource</ref> is the XML source file name, <ref>stylesheet</ref> is the XSL stylesheet file name, and <ref>outputfile</ref> is the output file name.</p>
<p>If you want the output to be displayed on the screen, simply omit the -out flag and argument.</p>
<p>You can use this utility to try out XSL stylesheets you have written, to make sure they do what you expect with the XML source files they are designed to transform. The utility provides useful messages if the source file or stylesheet is not well formed. For more information, see <link idref="commandline">Command-Line Utility</link>.</p>
</s2><anchor name="java-apps"/>
<s2 title="Setting up your own Java applications">
<p>You can start by using your own XML source files and XSL stylesheets with the sample applications, which illustrate a number of the <link idref="usagepatterns">basic usage patterns</link>.</p>
<p>Here is the basic TRaX procedure to keep in mind when you set up a transformation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <jump href="apidocs/javax/xml/transform/TransformerFactory.html">TransformerFactory</jump> static newInstance() method to instantiate a TransformerFactory.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Use the TransformerFactory newTransformer(Source stylesheet) method to process the transformation instructions in an XSLT stylesheet Source (producing under the covers a <jump href="apidocs/javax/xml/transform/Templates.html">Templates</jump> object) and generate a <jump href="apidocs/javax/xml/transform/Transformer.html">Transformer</jump>.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Use the Transformer transform(Source xmlSource, Result transformResult) method to apply the transformation instructions (the Templates object) to the XML Source and produce the transformation Result.<br/><br/></li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about this procedure and its variations, see <link idref="usagepatterns">Basic Usage Patterns</link>.</p>
