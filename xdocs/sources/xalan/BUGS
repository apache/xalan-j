<s3 title="Open bugs and bug reporting">
<p>&xslt4j-current; passes all conformance tests in our comprehensive test suite. We are not aware of any outstanding bugs in this release. We are aware, however, of a Xerces bug in &xml4j-used; which does affect &xslt4j;:</p>
<ul>
<li>&xml4j; 1.2.3 does not process namespaces in SAX events when parsing UTF-16 documents, which causes &xslt4j; to fail with UTF-16 documents. 
Xerces will post a fix shortly.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
<p>The Apache XML Bug Tracking System is currently not working. If you find a bug, please report it (with "Xalan-J 2 bug" in the subject line) to the <human-resource-ref idref="xalandev"/>. We strongly encourage you write patches for problems you find and submit them to <human-resource-ref idref="xalandev"/>. We review the patches we receive to make sure they do not break something else, and (assuming they do not) include them in our next release. In the interest of fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and addressing outstanding design issues, we sincerely want (and need!) your active participation in the ongoing development of Xalan.</p>
