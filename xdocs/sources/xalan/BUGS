<s3 title="Open bugs and bug reporting">
<p>We are aware of the following limitations and problems in this beta release:</p>
<ul>
<li>When format-number() should format NaN or infinity, it generates the wrong string if default strings are used. <em>Workaround:</em> declare the strings in an xsl:decimal-format instruction at the top of the stylesheet.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Text nodes containing entity references are split into multiple nodes.<br/><br/></li>

<li>The contains() function does not always recognize a character entity.<br/><br/></li>
<li>There are differences in the way 1.x and 2.0. handle space and linefeed characters.<br/><br/></li>
<li>In some cases, a named character (&quot; etc.) will be output when the literal character would have worked.<br/><br/></li>
<li>In some cases, a named character (&copy; etc.) will be output where 1.x would put out &amp;#ddd; or %hh encoding.<br/><br/></li>
<li>In some cases, a linefeed will be output where 1.x put out &amp;#10;.<br/><br/></li>
<li>In some cases, %hh encoding will be used in HTML attributes instead of a named character (e.g., &auml;).<br/><br/></li>
<li>In some cases, &amp;#ddd; encoding will be used in HTML attributes instead of %hh encoding.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Sometimes an &lt;?xml...?&gt; header is not being output when it should be.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Sometimes a META tag is output as it should be, but sometimes it's still missing or in the wrong place.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Sometimes a namespace declaration is missing or placed differently than before.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Sometimes a declaration for the default or XSLT namespace is added when not needed.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Some torturous axis paths came back with too many nodes.<br/><br/></li>
<li>The function-available and element-available tests don't report true for XSLT elements.<br/><br/></li>
<li>The namespace-alias capability is putting out the wrong prefix (needs research).<br/><br/></li>
<li>The name() function is not returning the null string for text and comments, as it should.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Some required CDATA markers are not being put out.<br/><br/></li>
<li>The special technique for generating boolean attributes in HTML doesn't work.<br/><br/></li>
<li>The xsl:version put out by system-property is not the spec version, as it should be.<br/><br/></li>
<li>A top-level variable/parameter declaration in an imported/included stylesheet is not global, as it should be.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Path steps beyond a union causes an invalid axis error.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Unable to select a variable with a QName.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Use of key() in match pattern has problems with descendants.<br/><br/></li>
<li>The unparsed-entity-uri() function fails.<br/><br/></li>
<li>The @namespace:* pattern is not assigned the appropriate priority for conflict resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apache XML Bug Tracking System is currently not working. If you find a bug, please report it (with "Xalan-J 2 bug" in the subject line) to the <human-resource-ref idref="xalandev"/>. We strongly encourage you write patches for problems you find and submit them to <human-resource-ref idref="xalandev"/>. We review the patches we receive to make sure they do not break something else, and (assuming they do not) include them in our next release. In the interest of fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and addressing outstanding design issues, we sincerely want (and need!) your active participation in the ongoing development of Xalan.</p>
