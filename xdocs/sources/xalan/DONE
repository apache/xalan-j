<s3 title="Changes since &xslt4j; version 2.0.D06">
<p><em>A new compatability JAR</em></p>
<p>This release includes a new JAR -- xalanj1compat.jar, that lets you rebuild your Xalan-Java 1.x applications to run with Xalan-Java 2. As a point of reference, this JAR includes the API required to recompile the Xalan-Java 1.x sample applications and run them with Xalan-Java 2. To use this compability layer with an existing Xalan-Java 1.x application, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place xalanj1compat.jar on the system classpath in front of the Xalan-Java 2 xalan.jar.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Recompile your application. It it does not compile, you may be using Xalan-Java 1.x API that the compatability layer does not support. <br/><br/></li>
<li>Run the recompiled application with xalanj1compat.jar on the system classpath in front of the Xalan-Java 2 xalan.jar.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want our Xalan-Java 1.x users to start using Xalan-Java 2. That is where we are concentrating our efforts to improve performance and fix any outstanding bugs. To see what portion of the Xalan-Java 1.x API we have included in xalanj1compat.jar, see <jump href="compat_apidocs/index.html">Xalan-Java 1 Compatability Javadoc</jump>. Xalan-Java 1.x extensions, for example, are not covered. If you feel that we should extend our compatablity JAR to support other Xalan-Java 1.x API calls, please let us know exactly what you would like to see.</p>
<p><em>Other changes</em></p>
<p>Along with performance enhancements, we have fixed a number of bugs found in Xalan-Java 2.0.D06:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixed handling of disable-output-escaping="no".<br/><br/></li>
<li>Fixed a bug with whitespace handling where Xalan was incorreclty chedking for whitespace stripping before collation of multiple whitespace events into a single text node.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Fixed exception handling problems in the ExtensionHandler and TransformerImpl.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Fixed a bug resetting parameters in Transformer clearParameters().</li>
</ol>
