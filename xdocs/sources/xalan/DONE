<s3 title="Changes since &xslt4j; version 2.0.D06">

<p>&xslt4j; 2.0.D07 incorporates a Xalan-Java 1 compatibility jar, some performance enhancements, and a number of bug fixes for bugs found in version 2.0.D06.</p>
<p><em>Compatibility jar: xalanj1compat.jar</em></p>
<p>This release includes a new JAR in the bin directory --xalanj1compat.jar, that lets you rebuild your Xalan-Java 1.x applications to run with Xalan-Java 2. As a point of reference, this JAR includes the API required to recompile the Xalan-Java 1.x core sample applications (excluding the sample extensions) and run them with Xalan-Java 2. To use this compatibility layer with an existing Xalan-Java 1.x application, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place xalanj1compat.jar on the system classpath in front of the Xalan-Java 2 xalan.jar (both are in the bin directory).<br/><br/></li>
<li>Recompile your application. It it does not compile, you may be using Xalan-Java 1.x API that the compatibility layer does not support. <br/><br/></li>
<li>Run the recompiled application with xalanj1compat.jar on the system classpath in front of the Xalan-Java 2 xalan.jar.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want our Xalan-Java 1.x users to start using Xalan-Java 2. That is where we are concentrating our efforts to improve performance and fix any outstanding bugs. To see what portion of the Xalan-Java 1.x API we have included in xalanj1compat.jar, see <jump href="compat_apidocs/index.html">Xalan-Java 1 compatibility Javadoc</jump>. For example, the compatibility layer does not support the use of Xalan-Java 1.x extensions. If you feel that we should extend our compatibility JAR to support additional Xalan-Java 1.x API calls, please let us know exactly what you would like to see.</p>
<p><em>Other changes</em></p>
<p>Along with performance enhancements, we have fixed a number of bugs found in Xalan-Java 2.0.D06:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixed handling of disable-output-escaping="no".  Previously, once it was turned on, it could not be turned off.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Fixed a bug with whitespace handling where Xalan was incorrectly checking for whitespace 
    stripping before collation of multiple whitespace events into a single text node.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Whitespace stripping wasn't working with input DOMs before.  This is now fixed.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Fixed many exception handling problems and problems with error reporting.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Fixed a bug resetting parameters in Transformer clearParameters().</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where CDATA sections were not matching the text() node test.</li>
<li>Made better memory allocation problem with result tree fragments.</li>
<li>Made result tree fragment parsing of numbers consistent with strings.</li>
<li>Exceptions thrown from extensions should now be properly reported via the error listener.</li>
<li>Fixed hard-coded stack dump set off by m_reportInPostExceptionFromThread variable.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent threading problem with text nodes being dropped.</li>
</ol>
