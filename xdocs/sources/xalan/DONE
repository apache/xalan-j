The conceptual organization has also changed somewhat: The primary transformation interfaces are defined in javax.xml.transform, with concrete classes for managing stream input/output, SAX parsers and ContentHandler, and DOM parsers and DOM trees in javax.xml.transform.stream, javax.xml.transform.sax, and javax.xml.transform.dom. For more information, see <resource-ref idref="trax"/>, and review <link idref="usagepatterns">Usage Patterns</link>.</p>
