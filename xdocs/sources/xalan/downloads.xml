</ul>
<anchor name="download"/>
<s2 title="Downloading what you need">
<p>To use &xslt4j;, you need the following:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>The JDK or JRE 1.2.2, 1.3.x, or 1.4.x</li>
    <li>xalan.jar</li>
    <li>xml-apis.jar</li>
    <li>&xml4j-jar;, or another <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">XML Parser</link></li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can get the JDK or JRE from <jump href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk">ibm.com/java/jdk/</jump> 
     or <jump href="http://www.java.sun.com">java.sun.com</jump>.</p> 
     
  <p>To get the &xslt4j; binary distribution (all you need to use and develop applications with &xslt4j;), 
     download and unzip either of the following from the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir"/>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-bin-zip"/></li>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-bin-targz"/></li>
    </ul>
  <p>The binary distribution contains &xslt4j-current; (xalan.jar and xml-apis.jar) and 
     &xml4j-jar; from <resource-ref idref="xml4j-used"/>.</p>
     
  <p>To get the &xslt4j; source distribution (with which you can do your own &xslt4j; build; see 
     <link idref="readme" anchor="build">Build notes</link>), download and unzip either of the 
     following from the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir"/>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-src-zip"/></li>
      <li><resource-ref idref="xslt4j-dist-src-targz"/></li>
    </ul>

  <p>To access previous releases, see the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir-previous"/>.</p>
  
  <p>If you plan to run <link idref="extensions">XSLT extensions</link> implemented in languages
     other than Java, then you will need bsf.jar, which is included in both the &xslt4j; binary 
     and source distributions. if you plan to run XSLT extensions implemented in scripting 
     languages, you will need bsf.jar and one or more additional files as indicated in 
     <link idref="extensions" anchor="supported-lang">extensions language requirements</link>.</p>
</s2>
<anchor name="whereis_xml4j"/>
<s2 title="Where do I get &xml4j;?">
<p>The &xslt4j; download includes &xml4j-jar; from &xml4j-used;. In conjunction with xml-apis.jar, 
this is all you need to run &xslt4j; with the &xml4j; XML parser. You can, however, download the 
complete &xml4j; binary or source distribution from the <resource-ref idref="xml4j-distdir"/>.</p>
<note>If you plan to use a different XML parser, see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">Plugging 
in a Transformer and XML parser</link>.</note>
