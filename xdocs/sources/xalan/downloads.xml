</ul>
<anchor name="download"/>
<s2 title="Downloading what you need">
<p>To use &xslt4j;, you need the following:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>The JDK or JRE 1.2.2, 1.3.x, or 1.4.x</li>
    <p>You can get the JDK or JRE from <jump href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk">ibm.com/java/jdk/</jump> 
     or <jump href="http://www.java.sun.com">java.sun.com</jump>.</p> 
    <li>xml-apis.jar (JAXP 1.2 implementation) and &xml4j-jar; from <resource-ref idref="xml4j-used"/> (or another <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">XML Parser</link>)</li>
    <p>These jars are packaged in the Xalan Java binary distributions.</p>
    <li>xalan.jar or xsltc.jar</li>
     <p>There are 2 binary distributions available; you only need to choose one of them.  
     Both binary distributions contain xml-apis.jar (the JAXP 1.2 implementation) and 
     &xml4j-jar; from <resource-ref idref="xml4j-used"/>.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The first binary distribution, &xslt4j-dist-bin;.zip or &xslt4j-dist-bin;.tar.gz, 
      contains the Xalan Interpretive processor, the Xalan Compiled processor (XSLTC) and the 
      runtime support packages in a single jar, called xalan.jar.  </li><br/><br/>
      <li>The second binary distribution, &xslt4j-dist-bin;-2jars.zip or &xslt4j-dist-bin;-2jars.tar.gz
      contains the Xalan Interpretive processor in xalan.jar, and the Xalan Compiled 
      processor (XSLTC) and the runtime support packages in xsltc.jar.  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The binary distributions can be downloaded from the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir"/>.</p>
     <li>(Optional) Xalan Java source code</li>
     <p>There is an optional source distribution available for doing your own &xslt4j; builds; see 
     <link idref="readme" anchor="build">Build notes</link>. You can download the source distribution from 
     the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir"/>.</p>     
     <li>(Optional) Packages to support extension functions and elements</li>
     <p>If you plan to run <link idref="extensions">XSLT extensions</link> implemented in languages
     other than Java, then you will need bsf.jar, which is included in both the &xslt4j; binary 
     and source distributions. if you plan to run XSLT extensions implemented in scripting 
     languages, you will need bsf.jar and one or more additional files as indicated in 
     <link idref="extensions" anchor="supported-lang">extensions language requirements</link>.</p>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To access previous releases, see the <resource-ref idref="xslt4j-distdir-previous"/>.</p>
  
</s2>
<anchor name="whereis_xml4j"/>
<s2 title="Where do I get &xml4j;?">
<p>The &xslt4j; download includes &xml4j-jar; from &xml4j-used;. In conjunction with xml-apis.jar, 
this is all you need to run &xslt4j; with the &xml4j; XML parser. You can, however, download the 
complete &xml4j; binary or source distribution from the <resource-ref idref="xml4j-distdir"/>.</p>
<note>If you plan to use a different XML parser, see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="plug">Plugging 
in a Transformer and XML parser</link>.</note>
