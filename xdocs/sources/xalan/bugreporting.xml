<s1 title="Reporting Bugs">
  <s2 title="Before you report a bug">
  <p>Before you report a bug, please, <em>read</em> the following instructions:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If doubt exists whether the behaviour in question is a bug or a feature, 
      please post a message to the 
      <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/mail.html#xalan-j-users">xalan-j-users@xml.apache.org</jump>
      list for clarification.</li>
  <li>To help eliminate duplicate or invalid bug reports, please take a quick look at
      bugs in JIRA to see whether the bug has been already reported and/or fixed. 
      You can also download the 
      <jump href="http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public-jars/xml-xalan2/">latest code</jump> 
      in CVS and check if you can reproduce the bug.</li>
  <li>Report bugs against the newest release.</li>
  <li>Read <jump href="http://issues.apache.org/jira">JIRA Notes</jump>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We strongly encourage you to write patches for problems you find and attach
     them to your JIRA issue. Being specific in the description of your bug report, and 
     providing enough information to reproduce the bug will improve the likelihood that 
     bugs, adding enhancements, and addressing outstanding design issues, we need your 
     active participation in the ongoing development of Xalan Java.</p>
  <note>If you had a bugzilla account previously, and had used it with Xalan bugzilla bugs, 
        your account should be migrated to JIRA. In this case, do not create a new account, 
        but use the same e-mail account name and click on "Forgot Password" on the JIRA home page.</note>
