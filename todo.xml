    Don published a list of proposed extensions a while ago.  
    I would really like to get these implemented.  This is a good 
    area for part-time contributers, as the extensions have limited scope.

    Joe could use help with the stylesheet compiler stuff.  
    Lots of work to be done there.  In particular, I would like to 
    figure out how to inline some simple itterator operations, 
    like select="node()" and select="foo".  Also, we need to figure 
    out how to analyze a particular stylesheet's dependencies, and 
    be able to package just those classes in a jar, along with the 
    compiled classes.
