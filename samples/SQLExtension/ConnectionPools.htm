	<title>SQL Extension; DB Connection Pools</title>
</head>
<body>
<hr />
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<hr />
<p>
   Database connection pools have been added to the Xalan SQL Extension 
   for two reasons. 
<ol>
 <li>A performance enhancement where consecutive transformation can reused
 databse connections without reallocating resources from the JDBC Driver. 
 </li>
 <li>A method to share databse connections created outside the scope of the
 Xalan XSLT process with the stylesheets that use the SQL extensions
 <li>
</ol>
</p>

 <h2>Requirments</h2>
 <hr />
 <p>
 <DL>
  <DT><i>Named Connection Pools</i></DT>
   <DD>Connection Pools will be refered to by name to provide a linkage to
   connection pools created outside the scope of the Xalan Processor. Named
   Connection Pools will also provide a mechinsim to support non-native
   connection used in JDBC 1.0 and JNDI references in JDBC 2.0
   </DD>
  <DT><i>Backwards Compatibility</i><DT>
   <DD>If the existing connection mechinsim is used (constructors in
   XConnection), crreate a connection pool on its behalf. The name of the 
   connecton pool will be the concatenation of the Driver name, DB URL, 
   User name and password.
   </DD>
  <DT><i>Connection Pool Wrapppers</i><DT>
   <DD>Implement a connection pool interface that defines the required
   beahvoiur for connection pools. This interface will be used to adapt
   other connection mechinsims to the Xalan SQL Extensions
   </DD>
  <DT><i>Minimal Dependancies</i></DT>
   <DD>The SQL Extension will implement a minimal default connection pool 
   mechinism. This will reduce the dependancy of third party libraries to 
   build and use the Xalan SQL Processor. Other wrappers can be written
   to adapt third party connection pools to the processor. A sample of the
   Apache Turbine project is planned as a sample for the project.
   </DD>
